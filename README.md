# SuperHero Hunter

##  *Introduction*
###  In this project we use Marvel API to fetch data of any hero/villian by searching its name in the search bar.
###  User can get more information about them by clicking on the name and add the character to their favorites list by clicking on the heart icon.
###  This project stores the favorite characters in the local storage so the result stays unchanged.
